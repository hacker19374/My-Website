      <div id="burgerC1" class="box">
        <h2>Burger Clicker 1</h2>
        <p>This is my very first HTML and JavaScript game I have ever made. I started it right around 2020, and stopped working on it in mid 2021. The goal is to the the most money possible by clicking the burger and buying upgrades.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="burgerC2" class="box">
        <h2>Burger Clicker 2</h2>
        <p>This is the sequel to my Burger Clicker 1 game. It has the same concept as the first Burger Clicker, click the burger, get money, buy upgrades. This one had two versions, the original one I started around when I finished Burger Clicker 1, and the new one I started in the beginning of January. It shares many of the same core features, but with more shop items to mimic Cookie Clicker, and with upgrades.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="webDt" class="box">
        <h2>Web Designer Tycoon</h2>
        <p>This was a game I made to test out the website <u>codepen.io</u>, and also to test out how to use JavaScript DOM functions. I was going to add a lot more to this game, but I just gave up.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chatbot" class="box">
        <h2>Chatbot</h2>
        <p>This is a chatbot concept that I made, with the help of ChatGPT. The only problem with this is that it doesn't work on all computers for some reason.<br> I might add more to this project in the future, but for now it will stay dormant.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="responsive" class="box">
        <h2>Responsive Website</h2>
        <p>This is a responsive website that I had to make for my SimplyCoding class that I am taking in school. It is my finished product and will not be updated any more.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="website" class="box">
        <h2>SimplyCoding Website</h2>
        <p>This was made as a "homepage" for all my websites made by following the SimplyCoding tutorials for each class. This may or may not be updated as I complete more classes, it depends what the requirements are.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="btc" class="box">
        <h2>Bitcoin Price</h2>
        <p>This is a website that I pretty much just copied from someone who made the bitcoin price as words. This was made using the coindesk API.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calculator" class="box">
        <h2>Calculator</h2>
        <p>This is a completely failed attempt at me trying to make a calculator using JS and HtML. Since I last updated it 2 years ago, I have learned a lot, and would probably be able to do it now, but I have so many other things I am working on that I just won't.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Citation" class="box">
        <h2>MLA Citation Generator</h2>
        <p>This is one of my newer things I tried to make, but it didn't work. I tried to use the fetch function to get the meta tags of a website to make an MLA citation generator, but I needed node.js and github doesn't do that.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="custom" class="box">
        <h2>My Custom SimplyCoding Game</h2>
        <p>This was the game I had to make for the last lesson of my JavaScript game design class in SimplyCoding. Sometimes it buggs out, but that is ok.</p>
