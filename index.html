        Web Designer Tycoon
      </h1>
      <p>This is a idle tycoon like game where you have to make money by making web programs. People buy your web programs for money. If you get better at coding (in the game) then you will get more money for each program you make. Itis currently in the BETA stage and it will get released after lots of testing and a couple more changes. Thank you for your patience.</p>
